Feature: Magento Customer report with Opportunity and Lead relations
  In order to manage reports
  As an Administrator
  I need to be able to use Opportunity and Lead relations in report for Magento Customer entity

  Scenario: Created report with Opportunity and Lead relations
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to Reports & Segments/ Manage Custom Reports
    And I click "Create Report"
    When I fill form with:
      | Name        | Magento Customer Report |
      | Entity      | Magento Customer        |
      | Report Type | Table                   |
    And I add the following columns:

      | Opportunity->Opportunity name |
      | Lead->Lead name               |
