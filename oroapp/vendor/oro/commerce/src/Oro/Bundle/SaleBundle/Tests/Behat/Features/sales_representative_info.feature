Feature: Sales Representative Info
  In order to provide the customer with the contact information of his primary assigned sales representative
  As an Administrator
  I want to enable displaying of sales rep contact information on the store frontend in the configuration

#  Description
#
#  Add a new configuration option on globale, organization and website level to enable displaying the primary sales representative contact info.
#  Allow to configure what (whose) information to show - customer user owner, customer owner, or configured for the website. For the last option - allow to specify the contact info.
#  When enabled, show the contact information of the selected sales representative in the store frontend footer.
#  If "Allow User Configuration" option is enabled in the system configuration, give admin users the ability to modify their customer visible contact info:
#  Don't Display Contact Info
#  Use My Profile Data - the contact info should be constructed using the predefined template (first + last name, phone number(s), email)
#  Use System - the contact info will be taken from the "Contact Details" field in the system configuration
#  Enter Manually - when selected, show additional field "Customer Visible Contact Info" - textarea.
#  Show only the options that are enabled in the system configuration in "Available User Options".
#  This user's "self-configuration" should happen in the user configuration (My Configuration in the user menu).
#  Configuration
#  System Configuration
#  Add new page - System -> Configuration -> COMMERCE -> Sales -> Contacts.
#  Add new setting to the page System -> Configuration -> COMMERCE -> Sales -> Contacts:
#  Customer Visible Contact Info:
#  Display - drop-down, default value - "don't display contact info", levels - global/organization/website :
#  Don't Display Contact Info
#  Customer User Owner
#  Customer Owner
#  Pre-Configured
#  Contact Details - textares, default value - no (empty), show this field only if "pre-configured" option was selected in the previous field, levels - global/organization/website
#  Allow User Configuration - checkbox, defaul value - checked, , levels - global/organization, hint -
#  When checked, the sales representatives will be able to choose one of the options enabled below.
#  Available User Options - multi-select, default selection - all options selected:
#  Don't Display Contact Info
#  Use User Profile Data
#  Enter Manually
#  User Configuration
#  Same page - System -> Configuration -> COMMERCE -> Sales -> Contacts.
#  Add new setting to the page System -> Configuration -> COMMERCE -> Sales -> Contacts:
#  Customer Visible Contact Info - drop-down, includes only the options enabled in "Available User Options" plus possibly "Use System" (see below), default value - see below, levels - user
#  Don't Display Contact Info
#  Use My Profile Data
#  Use System - this option is available only when "Display" setting in the system configuration is set to "Pre-Configured"
#  Enter Manually
#  Default value depends on teh "Display" field in the system configuration:
#  when "Don't Display Contact Info" -> then "Don't Display Contact Info"
#  when "Customer User Owner" -> then "Use My Profile Data"
#  when "Customer Owner" -> then "Use My Profile Data"
#  when "Pre-Configured" -> then "Use System"
#  Acceptance Criteria
#  Show that displaying sale rep info can be enabled/disabled per website/organization/globally
#  Show that each of the "Display" configuration options works (leads to showing contact info of different sales reps - customer user owner/customer owner/pre-configured on different levels)
#  Demonstrate how sales reps can choose one of the enabled options (when "allow user configuration" is on) and how that leads to showing different contact info on the store frontend.
