===========================

Bundle uses System Configuration to manage *Pay To*, *Send To*, *Sort Order*, *Label*, *Enabled* fields.

On the payment method selection step of the checkout process (both regular and alternative),

using the *Label* and *Sort Order* specified  in the System Configuration.

When this option is selected, appears *Pay To* and *Send To* configuration fields, like:
