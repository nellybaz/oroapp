Feature: Delete promo product from shopping list
  As a Customer User
  I need to have ability to delete promo product from shopping list

  Scenario: Check subtotal recalculation after delete promo product
    Given I signed in as AmandaRCole@example.org on the store frontend
    When I open page with shopping list List 1
    Then I see next line item discounts for shopping list "List 1":
      | SKU              | Discount |
      | SKU1             | $3.00    |
      | SKU2             | $1.00    |
    And I see next subtotals for "Shopping List":
      | Subtotal | Amount |
      | Discount | -$4.00 |
    Then I click delete line item "SKU1"
    And I click "Yes, Delete" in modal window
    And I see next line item discounts for shopping list "List 1":
      | SKU              | Discount |
      | SKU2             | $5.50    |
    And I see next subtotals for "Shopping List":
      | Subtotal | Amount |
      | Discount | -$5.50 |
