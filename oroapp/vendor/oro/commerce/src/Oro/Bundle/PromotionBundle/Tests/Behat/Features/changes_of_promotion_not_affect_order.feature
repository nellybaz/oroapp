Feature: Changes of Promotion not affect Order
  In order to be able to find out applied discounts for past order
  As an site user
  I need to have ability to see applied discounts for order, it shouldn't be affected by changes in related promotions

  Scenario: Check that order view has all needed information about promotion
    Given I login as AmandaRCole@example.org the "Buyer" at "first_session" session
    And I login as administrator and use in "second_session" as "Admin"
    And I disable inventory management
    And I proceed as the Buyer
    And I do the order through completion, and should be on order view page
    When I show column "Row Total (Discount Amount)" in "Order Line Items Grid" frontend grid
    And I show column "Row Total (After Discount Including Tax)" in "Order Line Items Grid" frontend grid
    And I show column "Row Total (After Discount Excluding Tax)" in "Order Line Items Grid" frontend grid
    Then I should see following "Order Line Items Grid" grid:
      | Product                | RTDA  | RTADIT | RTADET |
      | Product 1 Item #: SKU1 | $0.00 | $10.00 | $10.00 |
