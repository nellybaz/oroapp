Default Product Unit
====================

General Information
===================

If a category was selected at the [first step of product creation](./two-step-product-creation.md), then default product unit and unit precision values will be taken from the selected category.

If the product category does not have the default product unit set, then parent category will be taken in the category tree until default product unit is found.

If no default product unit was found in the category tree, or no category was selected at step 1, then the value from the system configuration will be taken.
