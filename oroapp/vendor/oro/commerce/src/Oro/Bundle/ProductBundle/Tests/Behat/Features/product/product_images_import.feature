Feature: Product Images Import
  ToDo: BAP-16103 Add missing descriptions to the Behat features
#  Would be good to add possibility to import product images via CSV file - e.g. there might be full paths to required images.
#  EDIT: Images will be uploaded though ftp or other method. Import process will parse the csv file with the image paths and link the images to the corresponding product.
#  EDIT: Check if it is possible to use same image for multiple products
#  EDIT 28.08.2017 :
#  As an Administrator
#  I want to be able to import product images by CSV file with the following structure:
#  |SKU	|Name	    |Main	|Listing|Additional|
#  |123AA|123AA_1.jpg|1	    |0      |1         |
#  1. On the server there will be a predefined folder where the images are previously uploaded.
#  2. The Administrator goes to Products list page where he will have a new option in the "Import' options : "Import product images from server'
#  3. Upload the csv file with the previous structure
