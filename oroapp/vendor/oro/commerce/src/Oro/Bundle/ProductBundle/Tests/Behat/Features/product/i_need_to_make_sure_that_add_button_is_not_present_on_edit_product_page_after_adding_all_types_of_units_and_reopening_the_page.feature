  In order to prevent to the "+Add' button from appearing for Additional Units if all type of units are added
  As administrator
  I need to make sure that "+Add' button" is not present on edit product page after I add all types of units and reopen the page

    #   Scenario: Preconditions
    #   I should have:
    #   Product:
    #   SKU     Name         Unit of Quantity   Additional Units
    #   003     Product_01   each               item

  Scenario: If add all "Additional Units" for product and reopen the page there should be no "+Add" button
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to Products/ Products
    And click edit "SKU003" in grid
    Then I should see "Add More Rows" element inside "Additional Units Form Section" element
    When set Additional Unit with:
      | Unit     | Precision | Rate |
      | Hour     | 0         | 10   |
      | Kilogram | 0         | 10   |
      | Piece    | 0         | 10   |
      | Set      | 0         | 10   |
    Then I should not see "Add More Rows" element inside "Additional Units Form Section" element
    And I save and close form
    When I press "Edit"
    Then I should not see "Add More Rows" element inside "Additional Units Form Section" element
