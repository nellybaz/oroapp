Feature: Product attribute datetime
  In order to have custom attributes for Product entity
  As an Administrator
  I need to be able to add product attribute and have attribute data in search, filter and sorter

  Scenario: Create product attribute
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to Products/ Product Attributes
    When I click "Create Attribute"
    And I fill form with:
      | Field Name | DateTimeField |
      | Type       | DateTime      |
    And I click "Continue"
    Then I should see that "Product Attribute Frontend Options" does not contain "Searchable"
    And I should see that "Product Attribute Frontend Options" does not contain "Filterable"
    And I should see that "Product Attribute Frontend Options" contains "Sortable"

    When I fill form with:
      | Sortable | Yes |
    And I save and close form
    Then I should see "Attribute was successfully saved" flash message
    And I should not see "Update schema"

    When I check "DateTime" in "Data Type" filter
    Then I should see following grid:
      | Name          | Storage type     |
      | DateTimeField | Serialized field |

  Scenario: Update product family with new attribute
    Given I go to Products/ Product Families
    When I click "Edit" on row "default_family" in grid
    And I fill "Product Family Form" with:
      | Attributes | [DateTimeField] |
    And I save and close form
    Then I should see "Successfully updated" flash message

  Scenario: Update product
    Given I go to Products/ Products
    When I click "Edit" on row "SKU123" in grid
    And I fill "Product Form" with:
      | DateTimeField | <DateTime:today> |
    And I save and close form
    Then I should see "Product has been saved" flash message

  Scenario: Check product grid sorter
    Given I login as AmandaRCole@example.org buyer
    When I click "NewCategory"
    Then grid sorter should have "DateTimeField" options
