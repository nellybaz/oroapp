  Scenario: Verify administrator is able Export Products from the system
    Given I login as administrator
    And I go to Products/ Products
    When I press "Export"
    Then I should see "Export started successfully. You will receive email notification upon completion." flash message
    #todo: to be implemented in scope of CRM-7599.
    #And Email should contains the following "Export performed successfully. 5 products were exported. Download" text
    And Exported file with Products contains at least the following data:
