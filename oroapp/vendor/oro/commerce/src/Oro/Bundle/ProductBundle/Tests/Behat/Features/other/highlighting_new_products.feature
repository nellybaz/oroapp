Feature: Highlighting new products
  In order to highlight selected new products
  As an Administrator
  I want to be able to mark certain products to be displayed as new on the store frontend

#  Description
#  Add a new product field "New Arrival" into the "General" section:
#  Type - Yes/No drop-down
#  Default value - "No"
#  Hint -
#  When set to "Yes" the product will be highlighted on the store frontend.
#  Modify the default frontend theme to highlight the new products (see the design below):
#  on grid views with images - show an additional stamp "New" on the product image
#  on the no-image-view - show "New Arrival" label below the "Item #: 1234" string
#  Add "New Arrival" column (optional, hidden by default) to the Products -> Products grid in the backoffice, enable inline editing for this column.
#  Add "New Arrival" filter (optional, hidden by default) to the Products -> Products grid in the backoffice.
#  Include the "New Arrival" fiedl into product export/import.
#  Please, also include the "Is Featured" field into product export/import.
#  Configuration
#  No configuration necessary.
#  Acceptance Criteria
#  Demonstrate how the user can mark some products as new arrivals and that they become highlighted on the store frontend in product listings in category and in search results
#  Demonstrate different types of highlighint in different grid views
#  Show that new arrivals can be included into a web-catalog product collection (see demo data below).
#  Sample Data
#  Modify the "New Arrivals" sub-nodes to be product collections which should include products marked as new arrivals in corresponsind categories.
#  Modify the product data so that 3-4 products within each of the categories are marked as new arrivals.
