    And I click on "Show Variants Dropdown"
    And I click "Add Product Collection"
    And I click "Content Variants"
    Then I should see 1 elements "Product Collection Variant Label"
    Then I should see an "Product Collection Preview Grid" element
    And I should see "No records found"
    And I should see 0 for "All Added" counter
    And I should see 0 for "Excluded" counter
    And I should see 0 for "Manually Added" counter
