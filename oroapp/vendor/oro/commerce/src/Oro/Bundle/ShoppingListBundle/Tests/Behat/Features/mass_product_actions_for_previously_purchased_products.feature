  I want to have ability to select multiple products and add them to a shopping list from previously purchased products

  Scenario: Create different window session
    Given sessions active:
      | Admin | first_session  |
      | Buyer | second_session |

  Scenario: Enable previously purchased section
    Given I operate as the Admin
    And I login as administrator
    When I go to System / Configuration
    And I follow "Commerce/Orders/Purchase History" on configuration sidebar
    And fill "Purchase History Settings Form" with:
      | Enable Purchase History Use Default | false |
      | Enable Purchase History             | true  |
    And I save setting
    Then I should see "Configuration saved" flash message

  Scenario: "Create New Shopping List" mass action for previously purchased products

    Then page has "Previously Purchased" header
    And I should see mass action checkbox in row with PSKU1 content for "Product Frontend Grid"
