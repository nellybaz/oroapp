  In order to change order statuses
  As an Administrator

    Then I should see that order internal status is "Open"
    And I should see available page actions:
      | Mark As Shipped |
      | Cancel          |
      | Close           |
    And I should not see following page actions:
      | Archive |

    And there is one record in grid
    And I should see following grid:
      | Order Number | Internal Status |
