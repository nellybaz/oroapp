ORM search engine
=================

OroSearchBundle provides ORM search engine out of the box. It stores index data in DB tables and uses fulltext
index to perform search. Bundle supports search index for both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** DBMS. ORM engine is used by default.

Configuration
-------------

ORM engine configuration stored at `Oro/Bundle/SearchBundle/Resources/config/oro/search_engine/orm.yml`
and do not require any additional engine parameters.

ORM search engine has quite straightforward implementation - it simply stores index data in appropriate tables:
separate tables for `text`, `datetime`, `decimal` and `integer` value, and another one table to store general information.
Table that stores text data has `fulltext` index.

```yml
parameters:
    oro_search.engine.class: Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Engine\Orm

services:
    oro_search.search.engine:
        class: %oro_search.engine.class%
        arguments:
            - @doctrine
            - @oro_entity.doctrine_helper
            - @oro_search.mapper
        calls:
            - [setLogQueries, [%oro_search.log_queries%]]
```

Each supported DBMS has it's own driver that knows about specific search implementation and generates valid SQL.

```yml
parameters:
    oro_search.drivers:
        pdo_mysql: Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Engine\Orm\PdoMysql
        pdo_pgsql: Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Engine\Orm\PdoPgsql
```

Features
--------

At current moment special characters are not supported in ORM search engines. 
Every character that is not a unicode letter or number is replaced with whitespace before the query.

Another one feature of ORM engine is fulltext index processing. Configuration defines fulltext manager
_Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Engine\FulltextIndexManager_ that used during installation and inside special listener -
it allows system to create fulltext indexes bypassing Doctrine processing.

**Note for MySQL driver:** MySQL has lower limit to the string length for fulltext index called
[ft_min_word_len](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_ft_min_word_len),
i.e. if string will be shorter than this limit then fulltext index will not be used. It's recommended
to [change this value to 3](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-fine-tuning.html).
