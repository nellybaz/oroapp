What are Processes?
-------------------

Processes provide possibility to automate tasks related to entity management. They are using main doctrine events
to perform described tasks at the right time. Each process can be performed immediately or after some timeout.
Processes use OroMessageQueue component and the bundle to provide possibility of delayed execution.

Main Entities
-------------

Processes are represented by three entities.

* **Definition** - main entity that contain information about specific process. It contains the most important
information: process related entity type (f.e. user) and what the actions must be performed with this entity
(f.e. change value of some field). Another important option is execution order that affects order of processes
execution if several process are subscribed on the same event of the same entity. Process can be enabled or disabled.
Other fields of the process definition contain information about process name, when this process has been created and
when it has been updated last time.

* **Trigger** - entity provides information about the trigger used to run the related process when
this process will be invoked. 
There are two types of triggers:
    - **event**
    First parameter is trigger event - one of ``create``, ``update`` or ``delete``;
    second parameter defines entity field name used to listen (used for ``update`` event only) and  process will be 
    invoked only if value of this field has been changed. Also trigger contains information about when process
    should be performed - immediately or after some delay (and delay interval in the seconds of PHP date interval 
    format). In case of delayed execution you can also control execution priority of process jobs.
    - **cron**
    Allows execution of a processes based on cron-definition. Cron definition itself is specified in ``cron`` parameter
    (e.g. ``*/1 * * * *``). These triggers can be executed only if system has configured cron script with the command
    ``oro:cron``.

    **Notice**
    Each trigger can define only one of these types.

* **Job** - entity that contain information specific to performing process in case of delayed processing
(in this case JMS job will be created). According to event job can contain following data:
    - ``create`` event - entity identity;
    - ``update`` event - entity identity and change set (old and new values);
    - ``delete`` event - entity plain fields (without references).

Also each job entity contains relation to the trigger used to create this job and entity hash (full class name
of the related entity plus identity of the specific entity). This entity hash is needed to find all registered jobs
for the same specific entity (f.e. to remove all related jobs).

How it works?
-------------

Each of process definition related to the some entity type (i.e. consists full class name) and each definition
can have several triggers.

When user performs some action with entity which is related to some enabled process definition,
all existing triggers for this process will be analyzed and found appropriate ones to execute.

There are two ways how trigger can be processed. First is immediate execution - in this case process action will be
executed right after entity will be flushed to the database or by cron schedule. Second is delayed execution - it creates job and puts it
to queue with specified priority. If some entity has several appropriate process triggers, then all of them
will be processed in order defined by definition.

After the specific entity item is deleted all job processes related to this entity also will be deleted.

**Attention:** performing of the action that was described in the process definition can provoke triggers
of other processes (or even same process). You should either use appropriate condition to avoid recursion or use 
option "exclude_definitions".

Configuration
-------------

All processes are described in configuration. Look at the example of simple process configuration that performs
some action with Contact entity.

```
processes:
    definitions:                                                 # list of definitions
        contact_definition:                                      # name of process definition
            label: 'Contact Definition'                          # label of the process definition
            enabled: true                                        # this definition is enabled (activated)
            entity: Oro\Bundle\ContactBundle\Entity\Contact   # related entity
            order: 20                                            # processing order
            exclude_definitions: [contact_definition]            # during handling those definitions won't trigger
            preconditions:                                       # List of preconditions to check before scheduling process
                @equal: [$source.name, 'other']                  # Perform process only for entities that have "other" source
            actions_configuration:                               # list of actions to perform
                - @find_entity:                                  # find existing entity
                    conditions:                                  # action conditions
                        @empty: $assignedTo                      # if field $assignedTo is empty
                    parameters:                                  # action parameters
                        class: Oro\Bundle\UserBundle\Entity\User # $assignedTo entity full class name
                        attribute: $assignedTo                   # name of attribute that will store entity
                        where:                                   # where conditions
                            username: 'admin'                    # username is 'admin'
    triggers:                                                    # list of triggers
        contact_definition:                                      # name of trigger
            -
                event: create                                    # event on which the trigger performed
            -
                event: update                                    # event on which the trigger performed
                field: assignedTo                                # field name to listen
                priority: 10                                     # priority of the job queue
                queued: true                                     # this process must be executed in queue
                time_shift: 60                                   # this process must be executed with 60 seconds delay
            -
                cron: */1 * * * *                                # execute process every 1 minute
```

This configuration describes process that relates to the ``Contact`` entity; every 1 minute, or every time when any contact is
created, or ``Assigned To`` field is changed, then current administrator user is set as assigned user.
In other words contact will be assigned to the current administrator.

Described logic is implemented using one definition and two triggers.
First trigger will be processed immediately after the contact is be created, and second one creates new process job
and put it to message queue with priority  ``10`` and time shift ``60``, so job will be processed one minute after
the triggered action.

When contact ``Assigned To`` field is updated then process "contact_definition" will be eventually handled and 
value  of ``Assigned To`` field could be changed. But option "exclude_definitions" is specified, thus this process won't
provoke self-triggering.

**Notes:** 

 - If you want to test this process configuration in real application, you can put this configuration in file
``Oro/Bundle/WorkflowBundle/Resources/config/oro/processes.yml`` and reload definitions using console command
``app/console oro:process:configuration:load`` - after that you can create ``Contact`` of changed assigned user
and ensure that process works.
 - Expression `$.` allows you to access main data container, for processes it is instance of `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Model\ProcessData`.
 - Expression `$` (shortcut) or `$.data` allows you to access current entity, above in example it's `Oro\Bundle\ContactBundle\Entity\Contact`.


Console commands
----------------

WorkflowBundle provides two following console commands to work with processes.

#### oro:process:configuration:load

This command loads processes configuration from *.yml configuration files to the database. It used
during application installation and update. Command has two optional options:

- **--directories** - specifies directories used to find configuration files (multiple values allowed);
- **--definitions** - specifies names of the process definitions that should be loaded (multiple values allowed).

**Note:** You should run this command if process configuration was changed to upload your changes to DB.

#### oro:process:handle-trigger

This command handle trigger with specified identifier and process name. Command has two required options:

- **--id** - identifier of the ProcessTrigger to handle
- **--name** - name of ProcessDefinition - trigger should belong this ProcessDefinition

REST API
--------

OroWorkflowBundle provides REST API that allows activation and deactivation of processes.

Activation URL attributes:
* **route:** ``oro_api_process_activate``
* **parameter:** processDefinition - name of the appropriate process definition

Deactivation URL attributes:
* **route:** ``oro_api_process_deactivate``
* **parameter:** processDefinition - name of the appropriate process definition
