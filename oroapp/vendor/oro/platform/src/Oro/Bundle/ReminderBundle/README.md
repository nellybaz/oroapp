# OroReminderBundle

OroReminderBundle introduces reminders in Oro applications. The reminder is a message that can be attached to an entity and is periodically sent to users via emails or WebSocket notifications. OroReminderBundle provides the interface for remindable entities and enables developers to set templates for reminder email notifications in the [entity configuration metadata](https://github.com/oroinc/platform/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/EntityConfigBundle).

Please see [documentation](./Resources/doc/index.md) for more details.
