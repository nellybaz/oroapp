# OroEntityPaginationBundle

OroEntityPaginationBundle enables pagination UI for a collection of entities when these entities are part of a data set of a DataGrid.

## How to enable pagination

To enable entity pagination you have to add option ``entity_pagination`` to a datagrid options. If this option
is enabled then session collects identifiers of entities at the first visit view or edit page of any entity from
specified grid, and these identifiers are used to generate links to a previous and next entities on this page.

Also datagrid must have column with the name same to entity identifier field that is used to collect identifiers. 
View and edit pages routes must have parameter with the same name.

**Example**

Let's assume that pagination must be enabled for the User entity with identifier column called "id".

1) Datagrid must have ``entity_pagination`` option in configuration:

```yml
datagrids:
    users-grid:
        ...
        options:
            entity_pagination: true
```

2) Datagrid has identifier column in result:

```yml
datagrids:
    users-grid:
        ...
        source:
            ...
            query:
                select:
                    - u.id
                    ...
        properties:
            id: ~
```

3) User view page route has identifier column in route parameters:

```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @Route("/view/{id}", name="oro_user_view", requirements={"id"="\d+"})
     * ...
     */
    public function viewAction(User $user)
    {
        ...
    }

    ...
}
```

## System Configuration

Entity pagination has two system configuration options to handle pagination process. These options are accessible
in section "System configuration" > "General setup" > "Display settings" > "Data Grid settings".

* **Record Pagination**, default is **true**, key _oro\_entity\_pagination.enabled_ - used to enable or disable
entity pagination all over the system
* **Record Pagination limit**, default is **1000**, key _oro\_entity\_pagination.limit_ - allows to set maximum number
of entities in grid for entity pagination (i.e. if number of entities in grid more than limit then entity pagination
will not be available)


## Backend processing

When user comes from grid with enabled entity pagination to view or edit page, grid parameters (filters, sorters etc.)
transmitted as url parameters in the browser address bar. Then entity pagination storage data collector send a query to
get all records with this grid parameters considering ACL permissions (for example edit ACL might be more strict
than view). There are two different scopes in storage for collect data. One scope is used to collect view pagination entities
identifiers and other scope to collect edit pagination entities identifiers.
Then collector fill view or edit scope storage depending on which page user visit. If limit of records count is more than
**Record Pagination limit** collector set empty array for this scope. Next time if storage has data for current scope
for current grid parameters, collector will not send request to get records. 
After switching back to datagrid both storage scopes are cleared.
There are ``EntityPaginationController`` actions for entity pagination navigation. Each action checks if pagination
identifier available and accessible. During pagination over entities other user can delete some
entities from the current scope. When user goes by navigation to this entity the message ``not_available`` will
be show and user will see next available entity. If ACL permission for entitiy in current scope was changed
and user goes by navigation to this entity the message ``not_accessible`` will be shown. Not available or not accessible entities deleted from storage, then entities identifier count refreshes and message ``stats_number_view_%count% `` is shown.

Default entity view has placeholder used to add entity pagination section. When user came to entity view page this
section shows pagination details (<M> of <N> entities, links to first, previous, next and last entities)
extracted from user session for current entity type.
