     * The following is an example for a block hierarchy:

     * <code>
     * form_widget
     * text_widget
     * url_widget
     * </code>
     *
     * In this example, "url_widget" is the most specific block, while the other
     * blocks are its ancestors in the hierarchy.
     *

     * is later passed to {@link renderBlock()} by the rendering algorithm.
